# How to Use SciDAP - Scientific Data Analysis Platform

## Create a New Project
You now have a Personal Laboratory. This is where you will do any analysis that you want to do.

Inside your Lab, Samples are organized into Projects.

### Currently you have no Projects in your Lab, to get started you will need to add one.

[Add a New Project](NEW_PROJECT)

You will need to attach CWL files to your Project as well. These are Workflow Pipelines that you will use when you run your analysis.
* When you create or edit a project you will be shown a large list of workflows to select from
* You can attach multiple different CWLs to a single project

Once you have a Project you will need to add a Sample to be processed by your Pipeline.

### You can also invite other SciDAP users to your Lab
