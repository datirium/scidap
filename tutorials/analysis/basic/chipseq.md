## The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

### Description

The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay is the gold standard technique to analyze the binding of transcription factors and cofactors to DNA and the localization of histones and histone modifications throughout the genome.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation protocols involve a multi-step process where each step is of crucial importance to obtain interpretable and reproducible ChIP results that can be trusted. Furthermore, ChIP assays generally require a relatively high amount of starting material, which is difficult to obtain for some sample types. Although the read-out for ChIP-Seq assays has become more efficient as a result of improvements to next-generation sequencing technology in recent years, the core principles of the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol itself have not significantly evolved since it was first developed over 30 years ago.

While the ChIP assay is still the primary method to investigate protein-chromatin interactions, alternative strategies are being developed to overcome some of the limitations of ChIP assays.

In particular, more and more scientists are starting to use Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) technology to investigate genomic localization of some histone modifications and transcription factors, especially with low cell numbers.

The CUT&Tag method is a variation of Active Motif’s patented TAM-ChIP™ technology. CUT&Tag is based on the main ChIP principles, antibody-based binding of the target protein or histone modification of interest, but instead of an immunoprecipitation step, antibody incubation is directly followed by the shearing of the chromatin and library preparation. CUT&Tag assays take advantage of a Tn5 transposase that is fused with protein A to direct the enzyme to the antibody bound to its target on chromatin. The Tn5 transposase is pre-loaded with sequencing adapters (generating the assembled pA-Tn5 adapter transposome) to carry out antibody-targeted tagmentation.

CUT&Tag shows a lot of promise and has the potential to alleviate some ChIP limitations, but it also has its own set of limitations that must be considered. This article covers what CUT&Tag is and describes the advantages and drawbacks of this method.
