## Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing

ATAC-Seq is a technique used in molecular biology to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility. The technique was first described as an alternative advanced method for MNase-seq, FAIRE-Seq and DNase-Seq. ATAC-seq is a faster and more sensitive analysis of the epigenome than DNase-seq or MNase-seq.

### Description

ATAC-Seq stands for Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing. The ATAC-Seq method relies on next-generation sequencing (NGS) library construction using the hyperactive transposase Tn5. NGS adapters are loaded onto the transposase, which allows simultaneous fragmentation of chromatin and integration of those adapters into open chromatin regions. The library that is generated can be sequenced by NGS and the regions of the genome with open or accessible chromatin are analyzed using bioinformatics.

The main advantages of ATAC-Seq compared to other techniques, such as FAIRE-Seq or DNase-Seq that investigate similar chromatin features, are the lower number of cells that are required for the assay and the relative simplicity of its two-step protocol.
