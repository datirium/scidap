## Thank you for choosing Scientific Data Analysis Platform

### Free cloud satellite

Free public satellite can be used for educational purposes. The data and samples will be deleted periodically.
Do not use private data. We are not responsible for data safety.
Public satellite is limited by memory and cpu power.

<!-- [To start using public satellite go to profiles settings.](platform/profile/satellites)

### How SciDAP works

How it works details can be found at [https://scidap.com/how-scidap-works.html](https://scidap.com/how-scidap-works.html).

In order to run the analysis [scidap.com](https://scidap.com) needs access to a private `scidap-satellite` installation. SciDAP provides a limited
and authorized access to the `scidap-satellite` installation. There are two types of `scidap-satellite` installation: per laboratory and corporate.
*For corporate installation please contact us*

**All laboratory members** can add the analysis and view the results. **Do not invite strangers** to the laboratory.

Latest installation manuals available at [https://scidap.com/tutorials](https://scidap.com/tutorials).

Datirium provides `scidap-satellite` bundle to simplify setup process. Otherwise
all the components must be installed and configured manually. `scidap-satellite` includes pre configured open-source software:

* [CWL-Airflow](https://github.com/Barski-lab/cwl-airflow) - python3 pipeline manager
* [aria2c](https://aria2.github.io/) - download manager
* [MongoDB 4.2.x](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) - NoSQL database
* [BioWardrobe-NG](https://github.com/Barski-lab/biowardrobe-ng) - micro-service to proxy commands from scidap.com to CWL-Airflow
* [pm2.io](pm2.io) - process management [https://github.com/Unitech/pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2)

The analysis runs on your hardware (where `scidap-satellite` is installed - desktop/server/cluster or cloud).
Some of our pipelines require at least 24GB of memory. We recommend **at least 32GB** per processing unit.

[scidap.com](https://scidap.com) can start a pipeline from any place with the Internet. However, to access all the results a **direct connection**
to the satellite is required.
Limited information is transferred between a `scidap-satellite` installation and [scidap.com](https://scidap.com):

* Sample's metadata
* Sample's [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org/) file (CWL files can be checked at [https://github.com/datirium/workflows](https://github.com/datirium/workflows))
* Sample's status like running, failed, finished
* Sample's mapping statistics for basic analysis
